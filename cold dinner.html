    <p>I come home upon the tails of a setting sun and on my kitchen-bench is my cold dinner. A sticky note beside it. </p>
       <p> OPEN STICKY NOTE </p>
        <p> Did that note take the light with it? It's all gone blue now. Colbalt blue by virtue of the blinds, or the curtains, or that sticky note. I can hear it outside. It is beginning to come on to rain. 
       <p> I place my cold dinner in the microwave for 3 minutes and 40 seconds. I cut my meal up and I place it on my tongue. It sits, heavy and sad, on my mouth and on my heart. Oh lord, here it comes. The familiar smells and flavours. </p>
      <p>  It was sunny and now its raining. </p>
       <p> I go outside. Why? My brain, my legs, or that sticky note.</p>
      <p>  It's not light rain. First it was light rain, but now it's heavy rain. It goes all over my face like a baptism. </p>

       <p> From a distance, it might look like I'm crying.</p>
       <p> Don't believe it.</p>
      <p>  Don't     believe            it.</p>
     <p>   Do   n't
          <p>              believe it.</p>
