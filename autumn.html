    Sunday morning and all the old leaves are pressed against the sky. The wildflowers are ready for their next stage, all bowing at my feet as they drop their seeds back into the earth. I’ve been asked how I changed, and I tell them it’s quite simple. I was once the road but now I’m the car.<br><br>
    Parmenides thought that there was no such thing as change.<br>
    Heraclitus thought the opposite. He said that change is the only constant. A mountain is always moving, a song is always changing, and the wildflowers are always shifting.<br>
    Change flows through life like water.
