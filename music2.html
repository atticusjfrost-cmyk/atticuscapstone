    Camera footage: sits down on bed. Sun streams through the curtain. Picks up music
box, plays it. You are my sunshine. Slowly shifts to piano version. Picks up a card:
‘My darling, I am so glad that you are feeling better about your worries. You are kind
and caring and you have many bright days ahead.
Love,
Mum’
